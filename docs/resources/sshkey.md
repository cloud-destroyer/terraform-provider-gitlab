## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String) The ssh key. The SSH key `comment` (trailing part) is optional and ignored for diffing, because GitLab overrides it with the username and GitLab hostname.
- `title` (String) The title of the ssh key.

### Optional

- `expires_at` (String) The expiration date of the SSH key in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The time when this key was created in GitLab.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `key_id` (Number) The ID of the ssh key.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# You can import the currently authorized user's ssh key using it's unique id. Find it by hovering a key URL in gitlab.
terraform import gitlab_sshkey.example 4349
```
